# 2048 Interpreter
A flex and bison based interpreter to play a variation of the 2048 game on the command line.
Written in C.

To run, clone the repo and run "make all". At the prompt, type "HELP." without the quotes at any time for syntax.

The game is an extension of the original 2048 game. In this version you specify the direction of the move along with the action (ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE) to be performed.
